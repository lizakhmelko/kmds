                            Cloudistics had the benefit of hindsight. We experienced the public cloud,
                            we tried do-it-your clouds and we found that costs and complexity kept us stuck 
                            with traditional virtualization platforms that were frustratingly limited, but
                            fit within our budgets.There had to be a better way. We looked at every other cloud and said,
                            “If they could do it all over again, what would they change?” That was the basis for
                            the design of the Cloudistics Cloud Platform. Like Tesla TM, who reinvented the car,
                            at Cloudistics, we reinvented the cloud.
