     <h1>Emoji</h1> 
     
     <p>(Japanese: 絵文字えもじ, English: /ɪˈmoʊdʒi/; Japanese: [emodʑi]; singular emoji, plural emoji or emojis[4]) are
            ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial
            expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. They are much like emoticons, but emoji are
            actual pictures instead of typographics.[5] Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵,
            "picture") + moji (文字, "character"); the resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely
            coincidental.[6] The ISO 15924 script code for emoji is Zsye.

            Originating on Japanese mobile phones in 1999, emoji became increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after being
            added to several mobile operating systems.[7][8][9] They are now considered to be a large part of popular culture in
            the west.[10] In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named the Face with Tears of Joy emoji the Word of the Year.[11]
            The development of emoji was predated by text-based emoticons,[12] as well as graphical representations, inside and
            outside of Japan.[13][14]
            
            The first emoji was created in 1999 in Japan by Shigetaka Kurita.[15][16] He was part of the team working on NTT
            DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform.[17] Kurita took inspiration from weather forecasts that used symbols to show
            weather, Chinese characters and street signs, and from manga that used stock symbols to express emotions, such as
            lightbulbs signifying inspiration.[18][19][17] Emoji were initially used (see Japanese mobile phone culture) by the
            Japanese mobile operators NTT DoCoMo, au, and SoftBank Mobile (formerly Vodafone). These companies each defined their
            own variants of emoji using proprietary standards. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of
            i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from
            other services.[7] Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other
            things in the city.[19]
            
            For NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, each emoji is drawn on a 12×12 pixel grid. When transmitted, emoji symbols are specified as a
            two-byte sequence, in the private-use range E63E through E757 in the Unicode character space, or F89F through F9FC for
            Shift JIS. The basic specification has 1706 symbols, with 76 more added in phones that support C-HTML 4.0.

            Emoji pictograms by Japanese mobile phone brand Au are specified using the IMG tag. SoftBank Mobile emoji are wrapped
            between SI/SO escape sequences, and support colors and animation. DoCoMo's emoji are the most compact to transmit while
            Au's version is more flexible and based on open standards.[citation needed]
            
            From 2010 onwards, some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, a standard system for indexing
            characters, which has allowed them to be used outside Japan and to be standardized across different operating systems.
