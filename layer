 <b>about company</b><br>
 Cloudistics had the benefit of hindsight. We experienced the public cloud,
 we tried do-it-your clouds and we found that costs and complexity kept us stuck 
 with traditional virtualization platforms that were frustratingly limited, but
 fit within our budgets.There had to be a better way. We looked at every other cloud and said,
 “If they could do it all over again, what would they change?” That was the basis for
 the design of the Cloudistics Cloud Platform. Like Tesla TM, who reinvented the car,
 at Cloudistics, we reinvented the cloud.
